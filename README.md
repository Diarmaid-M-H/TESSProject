## What is this project
This is my ongoing project to learn to work with NASA's TESS dataset. TESS stands for Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. It is a NASA space telescope focused on discovering exoplanets orbiting nearby bright stars. 

## What language and modules are used? 
Python, with the lightkurve package. Other packages will probably be used in future too.
